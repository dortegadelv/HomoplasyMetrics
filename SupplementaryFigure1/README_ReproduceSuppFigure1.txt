To generate the simulations data, we ran the perl script called Table_1_simulations.pl:

perl Table_1_simulations.pl

Then, we concatenate the results from each value of tau using:

bash ConcatenateData.sh

After that, we can re-generate the Supplementary Figure 1 by running the R script HomoplasyStepwiseModelCoalescent.R. Just be sure to set the directory variable to the path that contains the file “ConcatenatedData.txt” generated by the script ConcatenateData.sh
