To generate the simulations data, we ran the perl script called Table_1_simulations.pl after creating a folder called “Results”:

mkdir Results
perl Table_1_simulations.pl

Then, we concatenate the results from each value of tau using:

bash ConcatenateData.sh

After that, we can re-generate Figure 1 by running the R script HomoplasyStepwiseModelCoalescent.R. Just be sure to set the directory variable to the path that contains the file “ConcatenatedDataStepwiseCoalModel.txt” generated by the script ConcatenateData.sh
