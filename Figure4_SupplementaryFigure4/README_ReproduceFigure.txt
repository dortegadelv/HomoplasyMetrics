We ran Arlequin to calculate the tau parameter using the simulations from sets 2, 3 and 4 from the folder Figure3_SupplementaryFigure3. The results from Arlequin are found in Figure3_SupplementaryFigure3/Results/Set2/resultadosarlequin.txt
Figure3_SupplementaryFigure3/Results/Set3/resultadosarlequin.txt
Figure3_SupplementaryFigure3/Results/Set4/resultadosarlequin.txt

We also ran the program from Navascues et al (2009) Genetics (obtained from the author). The results are located in: Figure3_SupplementaryFigure3/Results/Set2/tauNavascues.txt
Figure3_SupplementaryFigure3/Results/Set3/tauNavascues.txt
Figure3_SupplementaryFigure3/Results/Set4/tauNavascues.txt

Then, we ran the script Homoplasy_tau_theta_ABC.R to produce the figures.
